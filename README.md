# WAICT

Who Am I Connected To ?
-----------------------

A linux and mac version of this shell script to show you who you are connected to on the internet
To keep the output simple I have tried to show just the organisation name that you might recognise.

How do I use it ?
-----------------

Download the appropriate file for your OS ( Mac or Linux )

For Mac OSX:

a) chmod +x macosx.waict.sh && ./macosx.waict.sh

or

b) bash ./macosx.waict.sh

For Linux:

a) chmod +x linux.waict.sh && ./linux.waict.sh

or

b) bash ./linux.waict.sh

What Happens when you run it ?
------------------------------

As long as you as connected to things on the internet, it should print out a list of IP's and their owners.
Here is an example from my mac:

➜  WAICT git:(master) ✗ chmod +x macosx.waict.sh && ./macosx.waict.sh
